      Each day's data is simply a snapshot of the contents of <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/768d990d-b5cc-459f-9d31-a8b68e950ae1/page/1uztB">RUSD's COVID-19 Public Dashboard</a> on that day.  RUSD's dashboard is updated throughout the day.  This page reflects the contents of the dashboard at about 8pm every night.  New data is posted here by 9pm every night.  If any <span style="color: #ff0000">red markers</span> are shown, they indicate days when no data was collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUSD provides numbers of active cases during a "14-day rolling window," so each individual case might be included in up to 14 consecutive days' data.  School cases include both students and staff at schools.  Staff in RUSD units not directly associated with a school are included in the "Non-school cases."
